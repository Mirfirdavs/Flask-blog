Hey All: As of version SQLAlchemy 3.0 
to create your db file you will need to run some commands like this in the shell :

from project import app, db
app.app_context().push()
db.create_all()

Then the .db file is created in a folder called "Instance" in your project. 
To add some users information from the terminal use this

from flask_blog import app, db
from flask_blog import User, Post

user_3 =User(username='Some', email='S@demo.com', password='password')
with app.app_context():
	db.session.add(user_3)
        db.session.commit()

and thats all.
after restructurization now you should import in this way:
from flask_blog import *
with app.app_context():
	db.create_all()
